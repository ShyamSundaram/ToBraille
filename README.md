# ToBraille
This repo includes the scripts involved in powering the Arduino device made to transcribe teal world text found in images into braille and display them on a dot-matrix display<br>
**Note:** The dot-matrix acts as a substitute for a real refreshable braille display. We couldn't get one because...well they aren't cheap!
